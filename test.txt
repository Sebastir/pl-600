Project Governance
  - Authority
  - Process
  - Evidence

If no process is in place, the solution architect should push for the creation of a governance process or create one themselves.

Governance Process
  - Risks
  - Issues
  - Changes

- The solution architect must acknowledge and share bad news early in the process.

Key Success Project
- Knowing what a finished project looks like from the customerâ€™s perspective, not yours
- Having change control board to manage Changes
- Managing Risk actively
- Performing Project Checkpoints to assess how you are doing
- Having retrospective and evaluating lessons learned to assess how you did

Establishing Standards
- Naming of Components
- Column data type
- UI layout
- Automation
- Security
- Development

Settings
Power Platform is a SaaS service from Microsoft Entra ID Tenant
Power Platform is licensed through M365
Power Platform runs on Azure
M365 uses Microsoft Entra ID tenant to control authent / authoriz


Location
The location of the tenant (billing) can be different from the location of an environment and its data.

When to use multiple environemnts
- Handling ALM (Dev, Test, Prod )
- isolate resources that are not used by the same users

Connecting to On-Prem
- VPN
- Azure ExpressRoute (private connectivity)

API
Power Platform uses Rest API to communicate between Apps / Data
Connectors and Dataverse use REST API and OData for requests and data.

Custom Connector
- Importing OpenAI definition to describe existing API
- Creating Microsoft Azure Function and then Azure API Management
- Creating Custom API to define your own actions

Custom Logic Limitation
You can't trigger Power Automate flows from calculated or rollup columns.
Rollup columns are only recalculated every hour.
Business rules can only access the columns on the form for its own table.
Classic workflows can't access rows in 1-to-many relationships.
Data that is changed by a business rule will not trigger an OnChange event that was created with JavaScript.

Async vs Sync Custom Logic
Sync -> User's screen is blocked until all operation are completed.
operation sync transaction are limited to a total of 2 minutes

Azure Bot Framework
Microsoft Azure Bot Service is part of Azure Bot Framework, a SDK uses to create Chatbot from code
A developer can connect an Azure Bot Service bot with the Language Understanding (LUIS) service within Azure Cognitive Services
A developer can also enable their bot to use a knowledge base that was created in QnA Maker.

Bots that are created with Azure Bot Framework can be integrated with Microsoft Copilot Studio bots.

Microsoft CoPilot Studio
A good Microsoft Copilot Studio copilot will have a high business impact,
 1. That is, a high level of traffic,
 2. A low level of integration complexity,
 3. A high level of conversation completion that is achieved without the need for escalation to a human agent.
A well-designed copilot will have a clearly defined set of goals, where each topic is linked to a business process and has trigger events, a clear set of rules, a set of documents, and a series of tasks that will be performed.
The solution architect might need to provide guidelines for creating topics and trigger phrases for copilot authors to follow.

Microsoft Copilot Studio requires a tenant license and a user license for anyone who will be building copilots.

Define the scope of the copilot.
Define the purpose of the copilot.
Define which channels that the copilot will be deployed to.
Define the key metrics and success criteria.
Verify the topics, entities, and conversational flows.

Microsoft Copilot Studio can pass parameters to a Power Automate cloud flow
and receive data back from the flow and use that data in the copilot's conversation flow.


Cognitive Services
Sentiment analysis
Image clasification
Form recognition

- You can use Azure Cognitive Services with Microsoft Copilot Studio by using Power Automate cloud flows and the associated Cognitive Services connector.
